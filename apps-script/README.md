# Shorashim booking backend

A Google Apps Script web app in the `shorashimzichron@gmail.com` account. It powers the website's availability calendar and booking requests. Google Calendar is the only record of bookings.

## Calendars

| Calendar | What goes there | Blocks the website? |
|---|---|---|
| **שורשים – הזמנות** | Confirmed stays, phone bookings, dates Saray wants closed | Yes, every event |
| **שורשים – בקשות** | Website requests waiting for approval (⏳) | Yes, for 24 hours after the request |
| **שורשים – ערוצים** | Bookings imported from Booking.com / Airbnb (not connected yet) | Yes |

Each booking is an all-day event from the check-in date to the check-out date. Google Calendar's own end date is exclusive, so an event on 20–23 September blocks the nights of the 20th, 21st and 22nd. A timed event (for example a cleaning from 09:00 to 17:00) blocks every night whose stay window, 15:00 to 11:00 the next day, it overlaps.

A bride day or "night before + bride day" on wedding date D holds the night before (D-1) and the wedding night (D).

## Google Drive folder

Everything for the site lives in the Drive folder **shorashim-webpage** of the Shorashim account:

| File | Sharing | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| **Shorashim Booking** (Apps Script) | Private | The booking backend |
| **שורשים – ניהול הזמנות** | Private | Tabs בקשות / הזמנות / ערוצים mirroring the calendars, with approve/decline |
| **שורשים – זמינות לאתר** | Anyone with the link (view) | A header row, then from, to, generatedAt and blocked nights. Dates only, no guest details |

The availability data is a separate file on purpose. The public file contains nothing but dates, so no sharing or publishing mistake can expose the guest details in the admin sheet. **Never share the admin sheet.**

The website reads the availability sheet's CSV export first, because Google answers it in well under a second. A cold call to the web app often takes 10 seconds or more. If the sheet is unreachable or its data is older than 30 minutes, the site asks the web app directly. The server re-checks every request, so stale availability can't cause a double booking.

Both spreadsheets are rewritten after every request or decision, whenever a booking calendar changes, and on a timer. Apps Script calendar change triggers only work on an account's primary calendar, and the booking calendars are secondary calendars. So `setup` falls back to a timer every 5 minutes, and Saray's own edits in Google Calendar reach the sheet and the website within about 5 minutes. The timer also lets expired holds drop out.

Calendars cannot be stored in Drive folders; they stay in Google Calendar.

## Day to day (Saray)

- **Close dates or add a phone booking:** create an event in **שורשים – הזמנות**. The website shows those nights as taken within about two minutes.
- **New website request:** an email arrives at shorashimzichron@gmail.com, and a ⏳ event appears in **שורשים – בקשות**. Tap **לאישור או דחייה** in the email:
  - **Approve** moves the stay into הזמנות. If the guest gave an email address, they get a Google Calendar invitation.
  - **Decline** removes the request and frees the dates.
  - Both screens offer a ready-made WhatsApp message to the guest.
- **Or decide from the sheet:** in **שורשים – ניהול הזמנות**, tab בקשות, choose אישור or דחייה in the **פעולה** column, then tick **ביצוע**. The tick is the confirmation, and it works in the Sheets phone app too. Decided requests stay at the bottom of the tab for 3 days with a WhatsApp link to the guest.
- **Unanswered requests** stop holding their dates after 24 hours and are marked ⌛ פג תוקף. They can still be approved while the dates are free.
- **Cancel a booking:** delete its event.

## Development

```
npm test                               # booking rules (apps-script/src/rules.js)
python3 apps-script/deploy.py "note"   # push code and update the web app deployment
```

- **`deploy.py`** uses the OAuth token in `~/.config/gcloud/shorashim/`. It reads IDs and secrets from `~/.config/gcloud/shorashim/booking-config.json`: calendar IDs, the HMAC key that signs approve/decline links, the reCAPTCHA secret, and the script and deployment IDs. It writes them into a generated `Config.js` that exists only inside the Apps Script project. This repo is public, so never commit those values.
- **The web app URL stays the same** across deploys. It goes in `src/data/bookingConfig.ts`.
- **Adding OAuth scopes:** push with `deploy.py --content-only`, have the owner run `setup` in the editor (signed in as shorashimzichron@gmail.com) to authorize the new scopes, then run `deploy.py` normally to release. Releasing first would break the live web app until the owner re-authorizes. `setup` is safe to re-run: it reinstalls the triggers and rewrites both spreadsheets.
- **Calendar access goes through the REST API** (`UrlFetchApp` with `ScriptApp.getOAuthToken()`). It creates an event with its details in one call and lists the three calendars in parallel. The manifest declares the Calendar advanced service; that declaration is what enables the Calendar API in the script's hidden default Cloud project, and without it the REST calls fail with 403. Event details live in **shared** extended properties, which is where `CalendarApp.setTag` stores them, so both APIs see the same data.
- **Request timings:** every successful request returns `timings` (milliseconds per step). The signed `?action=diag&t=<ms>&sig=<HMAC of "diag:"+t>` reports availability, snapshot and admin-sheet refresh times. The 5-minute timer also calls the web app, to keep Google from starting it cold for the next visitor.
- **Sheet protection:** the admin tabs are protected so only the owner can edit. For others, only פעולה and ביצוע in בקשות stay editable. The owner account itself can always edit everything.
- **Rules are shared by the script and the site:** `rules.js` is plain global functions, because Apps Script has no modules. The Node tests load it with `vm`. `src/lib/stay.ts` mirrors the date rules for the site; the server remains authoritative.
